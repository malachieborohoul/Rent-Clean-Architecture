**Rent: Building a Seamless Room Search Engine**

Looking for an efficient room rental search engine? Enter Rent! Our project aims to simplify your room-hunting experience by providing a streamlined search process. Each room in our dataset is rich in details, allowing users to apply tailored filters to refine their search criteria. 

This project is the practical embodiment of the concepts discussed in "Clean Architectures in Python" by Leonardo Giordani. It's designed to showcase the power of clean architecture principles applied to a room rental platform. 

Whether you prefer an in-memory database, Postgres, or MongoDB, Rent's REST API seamlessly integrates with these storage systems. 


Welcome to Rent - where your ideal room search begins effortlessly!
